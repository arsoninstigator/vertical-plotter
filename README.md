# picoplot

i'm planning to build a vertical pen plotter using the raspberry pi pico microcontroller by referencing hackaday's [pico plotter](https://hackaday.io/project/193338-minimal-pico-vertical-plotter) and the [original source](https://github.com/benevpi/Walldraw/). i will be programming using arduino and learning along the way.
